This experiment came with a few realizations:

* I prefer GitHub projects to gists. There is nothing too small to fit in
a GitHub project. It clutters up the project page but that bridge will
naturally be crossed by anyone who uses GitHub regularly, so it's not a 
concern of mine.
* View Source is doable even when you're using a heavyweight JavaScript
framework. Inline scripts are kinda neat. I'm not sure tools like CodePen
and jsfiddle are worth the silo effect they have, by virtue of splitting
up simple things into multiple text boxes.
* cdnjs is awesome and is worth using even for things hosted on Google's
AJAX APIs, if you trust CloudFlare to respect privacy more than Google.
* cdnjs might be gone someday, but so might Google AJAX APIs. Browser
extensions may help some.
* The sites these experiments are hosted on might be gone someday.
* 5apps is a neat alternative to GitHub pages. I wish it gave me my own
namespace like GitHub does, though.
* Angular.js can make a quintessential iterative programming problem look
declarative.
